#Modernitation of Clínica El Ávila Web
current proyect


From conception to implementation, I led and realized the project using various tools and technologies. I began with design in Figma, where I created the necessary wireframes and prototypes for the user interface. 
Then, I translated these designs into a React application using Vite as a rapid development environment.

To ensure a smooth and adaptable experience across different devices, I focused on developing CSS styles.
